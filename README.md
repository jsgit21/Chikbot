# Chikbot
Chikbot was born as a passion project around the time Wordle became popular. For a while I knew I wanted to build a Discord bot and experiment with what potential it could bring to my Discord server. The initial inspiration was being able to track individual's Wordle scores from day to day as a bit of friendly competition. After getting comfortable with the Node.js module known as Discord.js (https://discord.js.org/#/) I began to implement other functionality as well as work to have it fully hosted on Heroku utilizing a PostgreSQL database for storing my data.
